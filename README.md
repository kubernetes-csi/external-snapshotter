# CSI Snapshotter

The CSI external-snapshotter is part of Kubernetes implementation of [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec).

The volume snapshot feature supports CSI v1.0 and higher and it has been an Alpha feature in Kubernetes since v1.12.

## Overview

CSI Snapshotter is an external controller that watches Kubernetes Snapshot CRD objects and triggers CreateSnapshot/DeleteSnapshot against a CSI endpoint. Full design can be found at Kubernetes proposal at [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/csi-snapshot.md)

## Design

External snapshotter follows [controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md) pattern and uses informers to watch for `VolumeSnapshot` and `VolumeSnapshotContent` create/update/delete events. It filters out these objects with `Snapshotter==<CSI driver name>` specified in the associated VolumeSnapshotClass object and then processes these events in workqueues with exponential backoff.

### Snapshotter

Snapshotter talks to CSI over socket (/run/csi/socket by default, configurable by -csi-address). The snapshotter then:

* Discovers the supported snapshotter name by `GetDriverName` call.

* Uses ControllerGetCapabilities for find out if CSI driver supports `ControllerServiceCapability_RPC_CREATE_DELETE_SNAPSHOT` and `ControllerServiceCapability_RPC_LIST_SNAPSHOTS` calls. Otherwise, the controller will not start.

* Processes new/updated/deleted `VolumeSnapshots`: The snapshotter only processes `VolumeSnapshot` that has `snapshotter` specified in its `VolumeSnapshotClass` matches its driver name. The process workflow is as follows
  * If the snapshot status is `Ready`, the controller checks whether the snapshot and its content still binds correctly. If there is any problem with the binding (e.g., snapshot points to a non-exist snapshot content), update the snapshot status and emit event.
  * If the snapshot status is not ready, there are two cases.
    * `SnapshotContentName` is not empty: the controller verifies whether the snapshot content exists and also binds to the snapshot. If verification passes, the controller binds the snapshot and its content objects and marks it is ready. Otherwise, it updates the error status of the snapshot.
    * `SnapshotContentName` is set empty: the controller will first check whether there is already a content object which binds the snapshot correctly with snapshot uid (`VolumeSnapshotRef.UID`) specified. If so, the controller binds these two objects. Otherwise, the controller issues a create snapshot operation. Please note that if the error status shows that snapshot creation already failed before, it will not try to create snapshot again.

* Processes new/updated/deleted `VolumeSnapshotContents`: The snapshotter only processes `VolumeSnapshotContent` in which the CSI driver specified in the spec matches the controller's driver name.
  * If the `VolumeSnapshotRef` is set to nil, skip this content since it is not bound to any snapshot object.
  * Otherwise, the controller verifies whether the content object is correctly bound to a snapshot object. In case the `VolumeSnapshotRef.UID` is set but it does not match its snapshot object or snapshot no long exists, the content object and its associated snapshot will be deleted.

## Usage

### Running on command line

For debugging, it is possible to run snapshotter on command line. For example,

```bash
csi-snapshotter -kubeconfig ~/.kube/config -v 5 -csi-address /run/csi/socket
```

### Running in a statefulset

It is necessary to create a new service account and give it enough privileges to run the snapshotter. We provide .yaml files that deploy for use together with the hostpath example driver. A real production deployment must customize them:

```bash
for i in $(find deploy/kubernetes -name '*.yaml'); do kubectl create -f $i; done
```

### Running with Leader Election

If you want to run external-snapshotter with higher availability, you can enable resource based leader election. To enable this, set the following flags:
```bash
--leader-election=true
```

## Testing

Running Unit Tests:

```bash
go test -timeout 30s  github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/pkg/controller
```

## Dependency Management

```bash
dep ensure
```

To modify dependencies or versions change `./Gopkg.toml`
